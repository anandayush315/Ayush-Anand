      <li><strong>Part 1</strong>
        <ol type="i">
          <li><strong>If you want to gather honey, don't kick over the beehive
              <em>(Don't criticize, condemn or complain)</em></strong>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Criticsm is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually
                makes them strive to justify themselves. It is dangerous, because it wounds
                a person's precious pride, hurts their sense of importance, and arouses resentment </li>
              <li>
                Don't complain about the snow on your neighbour's roof, said Confucious,"
                when your doorstep is unclean"
              </li>
              <li>
                When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures
                of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with
                prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity
              </li>
              <li>
                Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain and most fools do. But it
                takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving.
              </li>
              <li>
                A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men
              </li>
              <li>
                Instead of condemning people, let's try to understand them. Let's try to
                figure out why they do what they do. That's a lot more profitable and
                intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness.
                <em>"To know all is to forgive all"</em>

          <li><strong>The big secret of dealing with people <em>(Give honest and sincere appreciation)</em></strong>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything
                And that is making the other person want to do it. <em>There is no other way</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                It is said that the deepest urge in human nature is "the desire
                to be important"
              </li>
              <li>
                Some of the things most people want include:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Health and the preservation of life.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Food
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Sleep
                  </li>

                    Money and the things money will buy
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Life in the hereafter
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The well being of our children
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A feeling of importance
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.
              </li>
              <li>
                When people lose their importance, they go in insanity, because they
                find a feeling of importance there that they were unable to achieve in
                the world of reality.
              </li>
              <li>
                If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually
                go insane about it, imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving
                people honest appreciation this side of insanity.
              </li>
              <li>
                When people don't like a thing, they bawl out their subordinates; if they
                do like it, they say nothing.
              </li>
              <li>
                In our generation people could have committed a crime if they let their
                families or employees go for six days without food; but they will let them
                go for six days, and six weeks, and sometimes sixty years without giving
                them the hearty appreciation that they crave almost as much as they crave food.
              </li>
              <li>
                Of course flattery works with discerning people. It is shallow, selfish
                and insincere. It ought to fail and it usually does. True, some people
                are so hungry, so thirsty, for appreciation that they will swallow anything,
                just as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Flattery is dangerous. But what's the difference between appreciation
                and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One
                comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish;
                the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.
