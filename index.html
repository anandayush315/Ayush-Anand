            <h3 class="right">How to win friends and influence people</h3>
            <p class="right-p">World famous psychologist B.F. Skinner proved that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much faster
              and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior.Since then, further studies have shown
              that this same principle applies to humans as well: Criticizing others doesn’t yield anything positive. We aren’t able to make
              real changes by criticizing people, and we’re instead often met with resentment. It’s important to remember that when dealing with
              people, we’re dealing not with creatures of logic, but with creatures of emotion, who are motivated by pride and ego.</p>

            <h3 class="left">Reasons to stay alive</h3>
            <p class="left-p">Everyone’s lives are touched by mental illness: if we do not suffer from it ourselves, then we have a friend or loved one who does. Matt’s frankness about his experiences is both inspiring to those who feel daunted by
              depression and illuminating to those who are mystified by it. Above all, his humor and encouragement never let us lose sight of hope. Speaking as his present self to his former self in the depths of depression, Matt is adamant that the
              oldest cliché is the truest—there is light at the end of the tunnel. He teaches us to celebrate the small joys and moments of peace that life brings, and reminds us that there are always reasons to stay alive..</p>

            <h3 class="left">Attitude is everything</h3>
            <p class="left-p">Attitude is Everything is a 1999 book broken down into 12 chapters, with each chapter relating to a specific lesson. This book summary will provide a concise outline of each lesson. The lessons relate to how you can
              harness
              the power of your attitude to reach your life goals. As humans, we have a tendency to focus on the negatives in life. Not only does this have a negative effect on those you are venting to, but it also impacts on your beliefs and your
              subsequent actions. Negative actions will prevent you from reaching your goals. This book will provide you with 12 lessons to help you teach yourself how to utilize your attitude to help you achieve your goals.</p>
